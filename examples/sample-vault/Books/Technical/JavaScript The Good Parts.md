# JavaScript: The Good Parts

By **Douglas Crockford**

## Summary

Most programming languages contain good and bad parts, but JavaScript has more than its share of the bad, having been developed and released in a hurry before it could be refined. This book scrapes away these bad features to reveal a subset of JavaScript that's more reliable, readable, and maintainable.

## Key Takeaways

1. Use === instead of ==
2. Avoid global variables
3. Use closures properly
4. Understand prototypal inheritance
5. Know the awful parts to avoid them
