# Clean Code: A Handbook of Agile Software Craftsmanship

By **Robert C. Martin**

## Summary

Even bad code can function. But if code isn't clean, it can bring a development organization to its knees. Every year, countless hours and significant resources are lost because of poorly written code.

## Key Takeaways

1. Meaningful names matter
2. Functions should do one thing
3. Comments are a failure to express yourself in code
4. Error handling is important
5. Write tests first (TDD)

## Favorite Quotes

> "Clean code is simple and direct. Clean code reads like well-written prose."

> "Indeed, the ratio of time spent reading versus writing is well over 10 to 1."
