# Harry Potter and the Sorcerer's Stone

By **J.K. Rowling**

## Summary

Harry Potter has never been the star of a Quidditch team, scoring points while riding a broom far above the ground. He knows no spells, has never helped to hatch a dragon, and has never worn a cloak of invisibility.

All he knows is a miserable life with the Dursleys, his horrible aunt and uncle, and their abominable son, Dudley - a great big swollen spoiled bully. Harry's room is a tiny closet at the foot of the stairs, and he hasn't had a birthday party in eleven years.

But all that is about to change when a mysterious letter arrives by owl messenger.

## Key Takeaways

1. The magic of friendship and loyalty
2. Good vs. Evil themes
3. The importance of choices over abilities
